# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 This is my private coding space! If you'd like to ask me anything or use any of the coding materials/APIs that I created, please ask me anytime! Though, please follow 3 rules in my space!
 ```
 1. no copyright issues plz
 2. never forget a smile!
 3. Lastly, be what you want to be!
 ```
### Machine_Learning_imgTraining
``` 
Machine_Learning_imgTraining was one of my early machine learning
experiences! The goal of it was to train an object, and see how it
correlates with the accuracy of the output.
```

### Flappy_bird_using_AI
``` 
Flappy_bird_using_AI was one of my simple python projects! The
goal of the project was to create the game flappy bird, and in
addition, create a reinforcement learning program which can teach
the computer itself how to play flappy bird.
```

### AllInOne_API
```
AllInOne_API is a respoitory I personally use when I want to use my 
own APIs for some projects I want to. It provides all the APIs 
I have created, and convenient for use. The packageInit files 
has all the functions which other files contain, and they exist 
for combining them into one.
```

### 3D_Volume_Measurement_Using_2D_images
```
3D_Volume_Measurement_Using_2D_images was my first corporation
related project! The goal of this project is to mathematically
calculate the length of the edges with 2D images.
```

### 6-Manhattan-FullStack-Development
```
6-Manhattan-FullStack-Development, once named "Python Enhanced," 
was my first CNN project! It gives an idea of how the data- 
processing and deep learning using CNN works.
```

### Residual Quantity in Percentage of Factory Machines Using ComputerVision and Mathematical Methods
```
Residual Quantity in Percentage of Factory Machines Using 
ComputerVision and Mathematical Methods is my first project that
I wrote an academic paper on. It may contain some gramatical 
errors and sound like a ludicrous idea, but it was one of my 
biggest project in November 9th, 2021.
```
